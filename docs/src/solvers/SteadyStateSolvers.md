# [Steady State Solvers](@id ss_solvers)

`solve(prob::SteadyStateProblem,alg;kwargs)`

Solves for the steady states in the problem defined by `prob` using the algorithm
`alg`. If no algorithm is given, a default algorithm will be chosen.

## Recommended Methods

Conversion to a NonlinearProblem is generally the fastest method. However, this will not
guarantee the preferred root, and thus if the preferred root is required, then it's
recommended that one uses `DynamicSS`. For `DynamicSS`, often an adaptive stiff
solver, like a Rosenbrock or BDF method (`Rodas5` or `QNDF`), is a good way to allow for
very large time steps as the steady state approaches.

!!! note
    
    The SteadyStateDiffEq.jl methods on a `SteadyStateProblem` respect the time definition
    in the nonlinear definition, i.e., `u' = f(u,t)` uses the correct values for `t` as the
    solution evolves. A conversion of a `SteadyStateProblem` to a `NonlinearProblem`
    replaces this with the nonlinear system `u' = f(u,âˆž)`, and thus the direct
    `SteadyStateProblem` approach can give different answers (i.e., the correct unique
    fixed point) on ODEs with non-autonomous dynamics.

## Full List of Methods

### Conversion to NonlinearProblem

Any `SteadyStateProblem` can be trivially converted to a `NonlinearProblem` via
`NonlinearProblem(prob::SteadyStateProblem)`. Using this approach, any of the solvers from
the [Nonlinear System Solvers page](@ref nonlinearsystemsolvers) can be used.

### SteadyStateDiffEq.jl

SteadyStateDiffEq.jl uses ODE solvers to iteratively approach the steady state. It is a
very stable method for solving nonlinear systems,
though often computationally more expensive than direct methods.

- `DynamicSS` : Uses an ODE solver to find the steady state. Automatically terminates when
  close to the steady state. `DynamicSS(alg; abstol=1e-8, reltol=1e-6, tspan=Inf)` requires
  that an ODE algorithm is given as the first argument. The absolute and relative tolerances
  specify the termination conditions on the derivative's closeness to zero. This internally
  uses the `TerminateSteadyState` callback from the Callback Library. The simulated time,
  for which the ODE is solved, can be limited by `tspan`.  If `tspan` is a number, it is
  equivalent to passing `(zero(tspan), tspan)`.

Example usage:

```julia
using NonlinearSolve, SteadyStateDiffEq, OrdinaryDiffEq
sol = solve(prob, DynamicSS(Tsit5()))

using Sundials
sol = solve(prob, DynamicSS(CVODE_BDF()), dt = 1.0)
```

!!! note
    
    If you use `CVODE_BDF` you may need to give a starting `dt` via `dt=....`.*
